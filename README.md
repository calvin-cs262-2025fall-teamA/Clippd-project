This one holds your project deliverables

**Vision Statement**\
For anyone who’s ever walked out of a salon with a haircut they didn’t want, our app makes finding the right stylist simple. Instead of just showing salon names and addresses, it puts the spotlight on the actual stylists—the people who matter most. Each stylist has a profile with their specialties, before-and-after photos, and reviews from real clients, so you know exactly who can deliver the style you’re looking for. With built-in booking and scheduling, you can go from browsing to appointment in just a few taps, and show up knowing you’re in good hands. For stylists, it’s a chance to showcase their best work, stand out for what they do best, and build lasting relationships with clients who appreciate their style. In short, it’s about making sure people leave the chair feeling confident, not disappointed.\

**Comparative Analysis**\
Current options for finding hairstylists all have noticeable gaps. Yelp and Google Reviews provide broad coverage of salons, but their reviews usually focus on the business as a whole rather than the individual stylist. Instagram and TikTok offer plenty of visual inspiration, yet they lack the structure for booking, pricing, or verified client feedback, which makes them unreliable for actually choosing who to trust with your hair. Existing booking platforms like StyleSeat, Booksy, or Fresha make scheduling easier, but they still center on salons and generic services rather than helping users discover the right stylist based on style, specialty, and real results.
Our app is stylist-centric rather than salon-centric, combining tagged portfolios, verified reviews from real bookings, and built-in scheduling. This gives customers confidence in choosing the right stylist while giving professionals a platform to showcase their unique skills—something existing review sites and booking apps don’t fully deliver.
